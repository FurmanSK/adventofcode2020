# Advent of Code 2020

Will try to finish all of them this year unlike years pasts. Also adding in pytest to work more on test cases

# Installation
``` git clone https://repo/.git```

Then you can cd into any directory to run each day.

# Testing
Day 1 - 3 don't have test cases yet but I will try to go back and add. 

Starting with Day 4 you can use pytest to run test cases I have made.

```
$> cd day4

$> pytest

$> python day4.py
```
